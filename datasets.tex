\section{Datasets}

The competition provides different datasets with different sizes and different quality. The first dataset, which is called \textit{byarticle} is manually classified and contains about 600 articles. 

The second dataset, which is called \textit{bypublisher}, contains over 600.000 articles and is classified based on the publisher. This makes the the quality of the dataset worse, but for systems where a lot of training data is needed, it might be an advantage. 

The problem with such large dataesets, is that there is a lot of computational power needed in order to train a network using this data. Therefore, during this research, a third dataset, called \textit{byart-bypub-mix} was created. This dataset consist out of the first \textit{byarticle} dataset with another $1100$ articles from the second dataset added.
