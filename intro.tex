\section{Introduction}
This report is part of a project at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, called Advanced Projects at the Quality and Usability Lab. During this project, the problem of hyperpartisian news detection will be solved using natural language processing. Hyperpartisian news is news that is extremely biased or sharply polarized in favor of a political party.

This problem comes from a task in the Semantic Evaluation\footnote{\url{https://pan.webis.de/semeval19/semeval19-web/}} competition which is held simultaneously during this project. This makes it possible to use the dataset provided to the participants of the competition. The goal of this project is to achieve a deeper understanding of the inner working of such a system and learn how to build such a system ourselves.
